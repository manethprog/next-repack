                <p>Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is a 2011 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3. It is the third main entry in the Uncharted series. Set two years after Among Thieves (2009), the single-player story follows Nathan Drake and his mentor Victor Sullivan as they search for the legendary lost city of Iram of the Pillars while battling a secret society led by Sullivan's former employer, Katherine Marlowe.

                    Development for Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception began in 2010. Development was approached by incorporating locations distinct from the series' previous entries, with the team deciding on deserts and urban areas, drawing inspiration for the plot from the life of archaeologist T. E. Lawrence. Naughty Dog sought to upgrade the game's openness and realism, increasing the volume of motion capture and voice acting, and conducting field research for better visual environments and sounds. The development team also aimed to improve the multiplayer system, introducing new competitive and co-operative modes, while the game is also notable for being one of the first to carry the new online PlayStation Network Pass feature.
                    
                    Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception received acclaim for its voice acting, graphics, story, and cinematic quality. Some criticized its linearity and found it inferior to its predecessor. The game received Game of the Year accolades from numerous publications and award events, and was a commercial success, selling over six million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling PlayStation 3 games. The game was followed by the sequel Uncharted 4: A Thief's End in 2016, and was re-released on PlayStation 4 as part of Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection.[3]
